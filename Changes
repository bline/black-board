    * Black::Board is now a MooseX::Singleton.
    * Black::Board::Message object now contains the current publisher, topic,
      and subscriber.
    * Black::Board::Message now contains the meta object from the creator of
      the message. Black::Board::publish() passes the caller()s meta object
      along to the message.
    * Several optimizations thanks to NYTProf!!
    * Updated synopsis examples.
    * added with_meta() to Message object to track where a message is created
    * added examples directory with a couple examples
    * added some tests, still not complete
    * added examples and a simple NYTProf html generator shell script
    * initial version
