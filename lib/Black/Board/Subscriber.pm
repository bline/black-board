=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the L<Subscriber|Black::Board::Types/TYPES/Subscriber> class for
L<Black::Board>. This is the class that represents a subscription to a specific
L<Topic|Black::Board::Topic>. It provides a delivery interface for dispatching
a L<Message|Black::Board::Message> to a C<CodeRef>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<subscription>

C<subscription> is an attribute which contains the C<CodeRef> called to deliver a
message. This C<CodeRef> should expect the L<Black::Board::Message> object as it's
only argument. This object will also be localized into C<$_>.

    Black::Board::Subscriber->new(
        subscription => sub {
            my $message = shift;
            # -or-
            my $message = $_
        }
    );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<deliver>

This method is usually called by L<Black::Board::Topic/METHODS/deliver>. It
takes the L<Black::Board::Message> object to be delivered.

This method sets the current C<Subscriber> in the L<Message> instance to
this C<Subscriber> until this delivery is over (local()).

See L</ATTRIBUTES/subscription> to see how the subscription is dispatched.
