DESCRIPTION
    This code is inspired by Bread::Board and even a few bits were stolen
    from it.

    The purpose of this module is to provide a publisher/subscriber
    interface for passing messages. This subscriber interface has the
    ability for subscribers to act as filters on the message. Each
    subscriber can return a modified copy of the message. The message is
    cloned because the same message object should be able to be sent on
    multiple dispatch chains.

CLASS ATTRIBUTES
  "Publisher"
    This is the singleton Publisher object. You can set this to a different
    Publisher object but you should do this before you start declaring
    Topics or be prepared to copy the previously registered Topics into the
    new object.

  "SubscriberClass"
    Used to create a "Subscriber" object when one is needed. Defaults to
    Black::Board::Subscriber. Can be changed to a custom topic class name
    for extending Black::Board.

  "TopicClass"
    Used to create a "Topic" object when one is needed. Defaults to
    Black::Board::Topic. Can be changed to a custom topic class name for
    extending Black::Board.

  "PublisherClass"
    Used to create a "Publisher" object when one is needed. Defaults to
    Black::Board::Publisher. Can be changed to a custom topic class name for
    extending Black::Board.

FUNCTIONS
  "topic"
    First argument is the topic name to create, any additional argument are
    passed off to "METHODS/subscriber" as new subscription callbacks.

    If the topic name already exists in the singleton "CLASS
    ATTRIBUTES/Publisher":

    1   If subscribers are specified, the subscribers will be subscribed to
        the

        already existing topic.

    2   If no subscribers are specified this topic call is an apparent no-op
        but

        does ensure the topic is created

  "subscriber"
    Create a new Black::Board::Subscription object and adds it to the topic
    specified. First argument is a Black::Board::Topic or the name of one
    already registered. The second argument should be a code reference. The
    code reference is passed off to Black::Board::Subscriber as the
    "subscription" callback.

  "publish"
    Publishes the given message to the given topic.

    Takes two conceptual arguments:

    The first argument can be the Black::Board::Topic object. If the first
    argument is a "TYPES/TopicName" in Black::Board::Types, it will be
    coerced by looking up the "TopicName" in the "CLASS
    ATTRIBUTES/Publisher". That failing, an exception will be thrown.

    Next you can pass in either a "HashRef" or a "Hash" (list of key/value
    pairs) which is converted into a "HashRef". This "HashRef" is taken as
    meta information for creating a Black::Board::Message object. All keys
    except those which start with a dash "-" are treated as
    "<Mmessage-"params>> key/value pairs.

    These are roughly equivalent:

        # simplest
        publish LogDispatch =>
            message => "I got here",
            level   => "debug";

    and

        # can use a hash reference
        publish LogDispatch => {
            message => "I got here",
            level   => "debug"
        };

    Keys which start with a dash "-", have the dash removed and are passed
    along to the "Black::Board::Message" constructor. for example:

        publish Foo =>
            -params => {
                hi => "there"
            };

    Here are some more equivalent examples matching the ones above:

        # ditch sugar completely
        Black::Board->Publisher->publish(
            topic   => Black::Board->Publisher->topic(
                "LogDispatch"
            ),
            message => Black::Board::Message->new(
                params => {
                    message => "I got here",
                    level   => "debug"
                }
            )
        );

    and

        # pass in the message as an object, maybe the same object from a previous
        # call to publish
        publish LogDispatch =>
            Black::Board::Message->new(
                params => {
                    message => "I got here",
                    level   => "debug"
                }
            );

    and

        # pass in the topic and message as objects
        publish
            Black::Board->Publisher->topic(
                "LogDispatch"
            ),
            Black::Board::Message->new(
                params => {
                    message => "I got here",
                    level   => "debug"
                }
            );

    NB: If you have a "-params" argument as well as non-dash arguments, the
    "-params" argument will be merged and will take precedence.

EXPORTS
    *   topic

    *   subscriber

    *   publish

SEE ALSO
    *   Black::Board::Publisher

        Dispatcher and owner of Topics

    *   Black::Board::Topic

        A Topic object is a place to subclass for custom Topics that handle
        something more complicated than a "param()" based message.

    *   Black::Board::Message

        A "param()" based Message. Subclass for a more complicated Message.

    *   Black::Board::Subscriber

        Encapsulates subscriber hooks to maintain consistent calling
        conventions.

    *   Black::Board::Types

        If you are doing any subclassing, look here for the MooseX::Types.
