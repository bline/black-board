=head1 DESCRIPTION

This code is inspired by L<Bread::Board> and even a few bits were stolen from
it.

The purpose of this module is to provide a publisher/subscriber interface for
passing messages. This subscriber interface has the ability for subscribers to
act as filters on the message. Each subscriber can return a modified copy of the
message.  The message is cloned because the same message object should be able
to be sent on multiple dispatch chains.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<Publisher>

This is the singleton L<Publisher|Black::Board::Publisher> object. You can set this to
a different Publisher object but you should do this before you start declaring Topics or
be prepared to copy the previously registered Topics into the new object.

=head2 C<SubscriberClass>

Used to create a C<Subscriber> object when one is needed. Defaults to
L<Black::Board::Subscriber>. Can be changed to a custom topic class name for
extending Black::Board.

=head2 C<TopicClass>

Used to create a C<Topic> object when one is needed. Defaults to
L<Black::Board::Topic>. Can be changed to a custom topic class name for
extending Black::Board.

=head2 C<PublisherClass>

Used to create a C<Publisher> object when one is needed. Defaults to
L<Black::Board::Publisher>. Can be changed to a custom topic class name for
extending Black::Board.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<topic>

First argument is the topic name to create, any additional arguments are passed
off to L</METHODS/subscriber> as new subscription callbacks.

If the topic name already exists in the singleton L</CLASS ATTRIBUTES/Publisher>:

=over 4

=item 1

If subscribers are specified, the subscribers will be subscribed to the

already existing topic.

=item 2

If no subscribers are specified this topic call is an apparent no-op but

does ensure the topic has been created

=back

=head2 C<subscriber>

Create a new L<Black::Board::Subscriber> object and adds it to the topic
specified.  The first argument is a L<Black::Board::Topic> object or the name
of one which is already registered to the Singleton that lives in
C<<Black::Board->Publisher()>>.  The second argument should be a code reference.
The code reference is passed off to L<Black::Board::Subscriber> as the
C<subscription> callback.

=head2 C<publish>

Publishes the given message to the given topic.

Takes two conceptual arguments:

The first argument can be the L<Black::Board::Topic> object. If the first
argument is a L<Black::Board::Types/TYPES/TopicName>, it will be coerced by
looking up the C<TopicName> in the L</CLASS ATTRIBUTES/Publisher>.  That
failing, an exception will be thrown.

Next you can pass in either a C<HashRef> or a C<Hash> (list of key/value pairs)
which is converted into a C<HashRef>.  This C<HashRef> is taken as meta
information for creating a L<Black::Board::Message> object. All keys except
those which start with a dash C<-> are treated as C<<Mmessage->params>>
key/value pairs.

These are roughly equivalent:

    # simplest
    publish LogDispatch =>
        message => "I got here",
        level   => "debug";

and

    # can use a hash reference
    publish LogDispatch => {
        message => "I got here",
        level   => "debug"
    };

Keys which start with a dash C<->, have the dash removed and are passed along
to the C<Black::Board::Message> constructor. for example:

    publish Foo =>
        -params => {
            hi => "there"
        };

Here are some more equivalent examples matching the ones above:

    # ditch sugar completely
    Black::Board->Publisher->publish(
        topic   => Black::Board->Publisher->topic(
            "LogDispatch"
        ),
        message => Black::Board::Message->new(
            params => {
                message => "I got here",
                level   => "debug"
            }
        )
    );

and

    # pass in the message as an object, maybe the same object from a previous
    # call to publish
    publish LogDispatch =>
        Black::Board::Message->new(
            params => {
                message => "I got here",
                level   => "debug"
            }
        );

and

    # pass in the topic and message as objects
    publish
        Black::Board->Publisher->topic(
            "LogDispatch"
        ),
        Black::Board::Message->new(
            params => {
                message => "I got here",
                level   => "debug"
            }
        );

NB: If you have a C<-params> argument as well as non-dash arguments, the
C<-params> argument will be merged and will take precedence.
