=head1 NAME

Black::Board::Message - C<param> based Message for L<Bread::Board>

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0002

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<publisher>

This is the L<Black::Board::Publisher> currently dispatching this message.
Subclasses can not override this because of optimizations.

=head2 C<topic>

This is the L<Black::Board::Topic> currently dispatching this message.
Subclasses can not override this because of optimizations.

=head2 C<subscriber>

This is the L<Black::Board::Subscriber> this message is currently being
dispatched to.
Subclasses can not override this because of optimizations.

=head2 C<bubble>

L<Black::Board::Subscriber> uses this flag to know if it should continue
dispatching the current subscription message.
Subclasses can not override this because of optimizations.

=head2 C<with_meta>

The meta object to make available to subscribers. If you used
L<Black::Board/FUNCTIONS/publish> to send this message, this is set
automatically to the calling packages meta object.
Subclasses can not override this because of optimizations.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<cancel_bubble>

This makes sense from the context of a L<Black::Board::Subscriber> subscription
callback. It allows you to cancel the current chain of subscriber dispatch.
This is usually done in end-point* subscribers. This object is returned with
bubble set to false.

* An example of an end-point is the subscriber in a C<LogDispatch> subscription
chain that dispatches to the log object. 

=head2 C<merge_params>

Merges C<HashRef> passed in with current C<<Message->params>>, the C<HashRef>
taking precedence.  Returns self.
